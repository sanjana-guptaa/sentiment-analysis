# Sentiment Analysis for Twitter Data

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of two sentiment analysis algorithms applied to Twitter data: Naive Bayes and Bi-LSTM. The primary goal is to analyze and understand sentiments expressed in tweets.

### Files

1. **Naive_Bayes.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook includes the implementation of the Naive Bayesian algorithm for sentiment analysis. It provides insights into how this algorithm can be applied to Twitter data.

2. **Bi-LSTM.ipynb**: The Bi-LSTM algorithm is implemented in this Jupyter Notebook. It focuses on leveraging Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sentiment analysis on Twitter data, exploring the nuances of deep learning for this task.

### Project Report

The project report file, **Project_Report.pdf**, contains a comprehensive overview of the sentiment analysis project. It encompasses:

- **Data Preprocessing Techniques**: A detailed description of the preprocessing steps applied to the Twitter data to make it suitable for sentiment analysis.
